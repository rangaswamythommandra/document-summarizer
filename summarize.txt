Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, employs neural networks for representation learning. It spans supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning paradigms. Diverse architectures like deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks find applications in various domains, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), inspired by biological systems, differ in dynamics and structure from biological brains. The term "deep" in deep learning denotes multiple layers in the network. Early research demonstrated limitations of linear perceptrons and the effectiveness of nonpolynomial activation functions in neural networks. Modern deep learning allows for numerous layers of bounded size, facilitating practical implementation and theoretical universality. It prioritizes efficiency, trainability, and understandability, departing from strict biological inspiration. Deep learning's versatility has led to significant advancements in fields like medicine and material inspection, often rivaling human expertise. Its dynamic and evolving nature continues to drive innovation and progress in artificial intelligence.
